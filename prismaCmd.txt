Now after we created our db models in prisma/schema.prisma we need to push them to our mongo db database
For that be sure that the link crom mongo db is added to .env like this one:
>>DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://apiasecki93:airbnb@cluster0.en8qhxh.mongodb.net/test" 
# !!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!
# at the end of the url I added /test because I was getting an error that the database didn't exist and this fixed it because it created a test database
# you can name it as you want for example /airbnbmongodb and then it will be automatycly created with this name

And run command:
>>npx prisma db push
Output:
D:\JavaScript\next.js\airbnb-clone-artweb>npx prisma db push
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma\schema.prisma
Datasource "db": MongoDB database "test" at "cluster0.en8qhxh.mongodb.net"
Applying the following changes:

[+] Collection `User`
[+] Collection `Account`
[+] Collection `Listing`
[+] Unique index `User_email_key` on ({"email":1})
[+] Unique index `Account_provider_providerAccountId_key` on ({"provider":1,"providerAccountId":1})


Your database indexes are now in sync with your Prisma schema. Done in 3.28s

For those who had problems with GitHub authentication.

In the official Prisma documentation, it's stated that Prisma only accepts camel case. So if GitHub wants it in this form: access-token, we will have to add a map function that changes it to the correct name. So, simply replace this line in schema.prisma:

old>> access_token String? @db.String
with this:
new>> access_token String? @db.String @db.String @map("accessToken")

Then, drop the document in MongoDB, delete the client in node_modules/prisma, and then use the command again:

npx prisma db push

However, if you get this error:
EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink
you will need to delete the entire Prisma module from node_modules, reinstall it, and then push the collections to MongoDB again.

1. to push db again just run:
>>npx prisma db push
to generate prisma client run:
>>npx prisma generate

if you get error EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink then:
delete the entire Prisma module from node_modules, reinstall it, and then push the collections to MongoDB again.
